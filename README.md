# UFO
## Overview of Project
We will be creating a webpage with a dynamic table. This table will utilized some given data which will react to user input. The user can see specific in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by the specific filters.
## Results:
At the bottom of the webpage, we have a collection of UFO sightings. The data is ordered by data but can be filtered to a specific date, city, state, country, or shape. For example: I want to look at a UFO siting in St. Louis, Missouri.<br/>

Or I want to look at a UFO siting on January 5, 2010 in the shape of a cigar.<br/>

## Summary
Drawback
- One drawback I see is the auto fill. Someone might think these places are filled or will get confused thinking they already have inputs. <br/>

Recommendations
- Add a function to update the data. Where people can input recent sightings so the data can always be updated. 
- Add a spot for videos. People would be able to watch videos of the sightings.
